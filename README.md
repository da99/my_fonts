Helv Font
==========
This is the Adobe bitmap font, Helvetica. The font name
has been changed to "Helv" in the source files
in order to not be used in applications
when "Helvetica" is requested. This Adobe version of the Helvetica
font is bitmap and does not look good in web pages and other
applications.

Note:
====================================

The hinting of some fonts may not look right.
It is usually because of the size.
For example, trying setting the font to 12 in Terminator.
